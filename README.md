# Data-Structures

This project will demo some of the commonly used data structures. Written in C++, it can imported onto any Visual C++ IDE. The C++ as such is platform agnostic and can be run in Unix based systems as well.

Data Structures covered at this point are :

# 1. Hash
Here, the code will demonstrate of 3 different types of hashing algorithms - Linear hashing, Quadratic hashing and Double hashing.

# 2. Queues
Queue is a FIFO structure. This code will demonstrate simple queue operations - addition and removal.

# 3. Binary Search Trees.
This code will demo insertion, traversal and deletion of nodes in Binary Search Tree. It also demonstrates how to traverse a tree breadth-wise.

# 4. Heap Trees.
Heap Trees are special trees in which the parent node is greater or lesser than its children. This code will demo the insertion and traversal of Maximum Heap tree (parent is greater than both the children). The program also shows how to sort and merge heaps.

# 5. Threaded Binary Trees.
These are special variations of Binary Tree in which leaf node will point to its successor node and predecessor node instead of pointing to NULL. This demo code implements the leaf node to point to the successor node. It also demonstates insertion, traversal and deletion of nodes.
